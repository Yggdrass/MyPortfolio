                <p id="indexParagraph">With the Gamehub page, I needed to change up on alot of issues since the assignment. I had used Gridbox and had to change to a better way using Flexbox. So there were alot of work needed to be done.
                    I changed the layout of each page with flexbox and it provided me with a better an easier way of working with the elements. This was a suggestion by a tutor. I see now what he meant and I will be using flexbox much more in the coming projects.
                    Due to time constraints I wasn't able to create a cart-page/page for buying a game from when you choose a "new" or "used"-option. I will add this in the future. Also I was not sure if we should add javascript etc that we learned after this assignment to this project now, so I used "< a href="samplepage.html " > sample button < / a >" as a button, because we had not yet learned how to use javascript to create and edit buttons.
                </p>
                <p id="indexParagraph">In this project-redo I changed the carousel-buttons on the index.html to three circles rather than having two arrows. I tried to use javascript to call the API and display a certain number of posts from wordpress, so the first circle showed the newest four posts, the second showed the previous four and so on. I wasn't able to make this work in time. Also there seem to be issues with one.com as a domain-renting. When you press a game you should be taken to that games wordpress post/page, but sometimes it doesn't do that and the page shows a "wordpress issue page". This is fixed when I go into wordpress on one.com and in the wp admin section. I will from now on find a better host for my domain as I have struggled with technical issues on several projects relating to wordpress on <one class="com"></one> </p>
                <p id="indexParagraph">I had issues with the uploading of the files of Flower Power to one.com in wordpress back when we did this assignment even though I followed the tutorvideo to the point. When I was working on my project exam I issues with one.com and wordpress to, as when I tried to activate the default theme on wp admin in wordpress, everything there crashed. This was a theme we was supposed to use in this project. So as at the time this is written my project exam has not been graded and I don't want to risk that project's files on wordpress to go bad, I didn't want to redo the upload of the flower power project. That's why there is no link in the flower power section. I have already done the project correctly but I don't want to risk the "project exam 1".</p>
