                        <p id="projectBrief">"Adventure Trails Hikes is a new business offering extreme hiking in a number of different countries.
                            It offers supervised hikes, ranging from short day tours to weeklong treks, with camping. The service
                            is aimed at college-educated professionals (men and women) between the ages of 18 to 35.
                            The focus is not just on the experience of nature but also the specific nation's culture and traditions.
                            Hike experiences will typically include traditional meals, music/theatre, as well as contact with the
                            local population. Additionally, the emphasis is on sustainable, environmentally behaviour and
                            respect for the local culture."</p>
                        <p id="projectBrief">In this project I was tasked of creating a website tailored towards young adults and show them different types of hikes. The whole project would consist of planning out the process using a Trello board, designing a logo and website. As well as follow the WCAG guidelines and design that capture the users focus and get them to engage with the website.</p>

                            <p id="card_brief">I wanted to capture the young user with an image of spectacular nature and a trail that entices the desire to go on a trail with this company. By using an image like this where there are people on a trail, make the user think about how it would feel to be that person. Also the title encourages the user to do something to fulfill their desire to go on a hike.</p>

                            <p id="card_brief">I went with a minimalistic design utilizing the whitespace in order for the user to easily direct their attention to the parts the client want them to focus on. Too much items like text or images will only clutter the page and confuse the user, this might make the user give up and find another website because they couldn't work out how to find the trails they wanted. The color also is simply just green and white/black. The focus of the client is that they focus on environmentally friendly trails, therefore I chose green as the main color as this symbolizes earth, growth and good health. The white and black makes it easier to see the text and images on the website.</p>

                            <p id="card_brief">The trail page I wanted to keep clean and easy for the user to navigate through the trails. Therefore I went with a design using the cards from the main page, so they can quickly scan each trail and find the one that speaks most to them. The idea is that if the user wants to learn more about the specific trail they can press the card and be directed to a more detailed page for this single trail.</p>

                            <p id="card_brief">I had searched for similar types of websites to get inspiration to how they designed their treks. I went with the design above, making sure that the most important info on the selected trek was in this card. If the website would be worked on more, the card would direct the user to a single page with alot more info on the trail. But in order for the user to quickly decide subconsciously if this is a trail for them or not, then the most important info is shown so the user can decide without effort and find the trail for them.</p>

                            The last part was setting up a headless wordpress API and then fetch that data using Javascript and show the info of the game the user clicked on, on a seperate page.

In Design 1 we got a brief consisting of the clients info on target audience, site architecture, slogans etc. In my brief the target audience was aged 18 to 25 and the website's function is to buy and sell both used and new games at a competative price. Wen building and designing each page I had these parts and WCAG guidelines in mind as well. It is important to design the website to reach the target audience in order for the company to reach their desired goal of the website.</p>
